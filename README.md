<b>Installation</b> 

Order if not deploying all at once via Ant etc.
1) Apex classes (AndeeWorkbenchController, AndeeWorkbenchController_Test, BatchAndeeWorkbench & BatchAndeeWorkbench_Test
2) All Static Resources
3) LWC - areYouSure
4) LWC - andeeZombie
5) LWC - andeeWorkbench

Easiest way is to download the metadata to your VSC folder & then just deploy from there.

Once completed I'd suggest Setup | Lightning App Builder | New.  Create an App Page, Label : Workbench, One Region, add the custom andeeWorkbench & Save.  Finally activate the page by adding the required profiles/lightning apps as required.
